The issue with creating snapshot policies for file systems is due to **missing FSS (File Storage Service) snapshot policy permissions**. Here's the problem and solution:

## Root Cause

The user currently has:
```
Allow group BFL-OCI-IDT/SG-BFL-OCI-PRD-SRV-ADMIN to manage file-family in tenancy where request.permission!='*_DELETE'
```

While `file-family` includes many FSS resources, **snapshot policies require specific permissions** that may not be fully covered, especially when working with file system snapshots and their policies.

## Required Permissions for FSS Snapshot Policies

To create and manage snapshot policies for file systems, add these specific permissions:

### 1. **File System Snapshot Policy Management**
```
Allow group BFL-OCI-IDT/SG-BFL-OCI-PRD-SRV-ADMIN to manage file-systems in tenancy where request.permission!='*_DELETE'
Allow group BFL-OCI-IDT/SG-BFL-OCI-PRD-SRV-ADMIN to manage mount-targets in tenancy where request.permission!='*_DELETE'
Allow group BFL-OCI-IDT/SG-BFL-OCI-PRD-SRV-ADMIN to manage export-sets in tenancy where request.permission!='*_DELETE'
Allow group BFL-OCI-IDT/SG-BFL-OCI-PRD-SRV-ADMIN to manage file-system-snapshots in tenancy where request.permission!='*_DELETE'
Allow group BFL-OCI-IDT/SG-BFL-OCI-PRD-SRV-ADMIN to manage filesystem-snapshot-policies in tenancy where request.permission!='*_DELETE'
```

## Complete Solution

Since the user already has `manage file-family`, you should verify if the issue is related to **compartment-level restrictions**. The current policy applies at the tenancy level, but if the file systems are in specific compartments, you might need compartment-specific permissions.

### Option 1: If file-family should cover it (check for other issues)
Verify:
- The user is trying to create the snapshot policy in the correct compartment
- There are no deny policies blocking this action
- The file system exists and is accessible

### Option 2: Add explicit snapshot policy permissions (recommended)
Replace or supplement the existing `file-family` policy with more granular permissions:

```
Allow group BFL-OCI-IDT/SG-BFL-OCI-PRD-SRV-ADMIN to manage filesystem-snapshot-policies in tenancy
Allow group BFL-OCI-IDT/SG-BFL-OCI-PRD-SRV-ADMIN to manage file-system-snapshots in tenancy where request.permission!='*_DELETE'
```

## Summary of All Missing Permissions

To resolve both the **customer-managed key** and **FSS snapshot policy** issues, add these policies:

```
# For Customer-Managed Keys on Volumes
Allow group BFL-OCI-IDT/SG-BFL-OCI-PRD-SRV-ADMIN to manage keys in compartment HOME:BFL-OCI-SHARED:BFL-OCI-SHARED-SEC
Allow group BFL-OCI-IDT/SG-BFL-OCI-PRD-SRV-ADMIN to use key-delegate in compartment HOME:BFL-OCI-SHARED:BFL-OCI-SHARED-SEC

# For FSS Snapshot Policies
Allow group BFL-OCI-IDT/SG-BFL-OCI-PRD-SRV-ADMIN to manage filesystem-snapshot-policies in tenancy
Allow group BFL-OCI-IDT/SG-BFL-OCI-PRD-SRV-ADMIN to manage file-system-snapshots in tenancy where request.permission!='*_DELETE'
```

## Verification Steps

1. Add the policies through OCI Console or CLI
2. Wait 1-2 minutes for policy propagation
3. Have the user log out and log back in
4. Retry creating the snapshot policy for the file system

The unauthorized access errors should now be resolved for both issues.
